Economic Inequality, Demand for Redistribution, and Redistributive Outcomes: Building the Empirical Foundations for Dynamic Comparative Research

Does rising income inequality in a country yield greater demand for more redistributive policy among its citizens?  Does greater public demand prompt more redistribution?  The answers to both of these questions are clearly not simply yes or no, but conditional on  other circumstances.  Assessing hypotheses regarding these circumstances will require comparable data--on inequality, on public opinion, and on redistribution--across space and time.  This paper takes up that task.  It first evaluates the author's long-running project, the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), as a source of data on income inequality and redistribution for this purpose.  It then applies the author's new approach, Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion (DCPO), to overcome the sparsity and incomparability of available survey data and provide comparable estimates of public opinion regarding redistribution for many countries over many years.  Finally, it offers an appraisal of whether the combination of these two datasets can serve as a sound basis for further investigation of these two questions on the consequences of income inequality for politics and policy.
